Little bird

have you got a key?

Unlock the lock

inside of me

Where will you go?

Keep yourself afloat

Feeling old

Unfolding
  Bb Gm         Dm F
Caught me a long wind

   Gm               F
Where will we go?

[Verse 2]
                     Dm
I caught a long wind
             Gm
A long life wind

Bb Gm         Dm F
I got to know the sky
 Bb Gm         Dm F
But it didn't know me
 Bb Gm         Dm F
Got to see the light
 Bb Gm         Dm F
And land on top of the sea
 Bb Gm         Dm F
And be the bird, be the key
 Bb Gm         Dm F
And now the current tells
 Bb Gm         Dm F
What the wave withheld
 Bb Gm         Dm F
And then the lightning say
 Bb Gm         Dm F
Oh where light will lay

[ch]
 Gm               	  F
	Where will you go?
  Gm              C Am
Keep yourself afloat

CODA
                     Dm
I caught a long wind
              Gm
A long life wind
              Am
Like a swallow
           Dm
A night owl
                   Gm
A little chickadee
           Am
Sad sparrow
                 Dm
Good morning bird
                Gm
Good nightingale
                    Am
I took a deep breath
                       Dm
And caught a long wind
