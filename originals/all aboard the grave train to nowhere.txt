All aboard the gravy train to nowhere


[Verse 1]
D                  Am           Em       D
We're gonna be swimming in that dopamine sky
Am                Em                 G                  C            D
  You're gonna be grinning with that look in your, that look in your eye
D            Am               Em      D
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to bank
D             Am                  D
It's really gonna be somethin', and it's gonna be, it's gonna be...

[Pre-chorus]
F        C                   G     D
and it's gonna be a long long time
F
golden hand cuffs, expensive wine
F    C                G         D
while another year bites the dust
F    G         D     F          G           D
all aboard the gravy train that never leaves

[Chorus]
F/d      C/a                 G/e   D
and it's gonna be a long long time
F/A            G/e
all aboard the gravy train...

to nowhere

D/F#  F  C  Am  D




notes:
pour the nectar directly into my gullet
don't bother passing it along my tongue
we'll trick the young to graze until they're numb

progressively sickening scenes of greed and privellege and unhappiness
