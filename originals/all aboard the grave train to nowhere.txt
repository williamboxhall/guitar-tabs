All aboard the gravy train to nowhere


[Verse 1]
D                  Am           Em       D
We're gonna be swimming in that dopamine sky
Am                Em             C            D
  You're gonna be grinning with that look in your eye
D            Am               Em      D
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to bank
Am                Em             G				C            D
It's really gonna be somethin', and it's gonna be, it's gonna be...

[chorus]
F/d         C/d               G         D
   and it's gonna be a long long time
F	   G                F 		    G
golden handcuffs, 'n' a bite of the crust
F    C                G         D
while another year turns to dust
F    G         D     F        G         D
all aboard the gravy train

[refrain]
F/d      C/a                 G/e   D
and it's gonna be a long long time
F/A            G/e				D
all aboard the gravy train... to nowhere
