The hatchlings waiting in their nest
waiting for their mother's crest
her [welcome] beak to bring the worm to rest

beating hearts and beating wings
the babies make it through the spring
to spread their wings and glide along the wind

<key change>
their mother was a little one
sharply witted, barbed of tongue
[glassy eyed]
her happy cry brought joy to everyone

the summer is a nasty one
autumn mushrooms on the wood
the winter sunset brings the term to close
