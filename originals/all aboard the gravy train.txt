[Lyrics]
[Intro / Verse 1]
You're gonna be dancin' all of the time
We'll meet together at the end of the line

[Extended Chorus]
But it's gonna be a long long time
Just waiting to arrive
Watch another year pass on by
All aboard the gravy train...
And it's gonna be a long long time
All aboard the gravy train... to nowhere

[Verse 2]
We're gonna be swimming in that dopamine sky
You're gonna be grinning with that look in your eye
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to bank
It's really gonna be somethin', and it's gonna be, it's gonna be...

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a long long time
Just waiting to arrive
Watch another year pass on by
All aboard the gravy train to nowhere

[Verse 3]
You've got your ticket and your Samsonite bag
Conductor's yellin' 'bout your luggage tag
You sit and wonder how long this'll all last
Stare out the window but nothin' moves, but nothin' moves past

[Chorus]
And it's gonna be a long long time
Just waiting to arrive
Watch another year pass on by
All aboard the gravy train to nowhere

[Verse 4]
Your golden handcuffs keep you chained to your desk
The company logo is pinned to your chest
They gave you a rolex at twenty five years
Your clip-on neck-tie got stuck in the, stuck in the gears

[Extended Chorus]
It's gonna be a long long time
Just waiting to arrive
Watch another year pass on by
All aboard the gravy train...
And it's gonna be a long long time
All aboard the gravy train... to nowhere

[Short instrumental bridge]

[Outro half-verse]
You're gonna be dancin' all of the time
We'll meet together at the end of the line

[Outro Instrumental]
