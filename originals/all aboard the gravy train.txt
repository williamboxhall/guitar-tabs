[Lyrics]
We're gonna be swimming in that dopamine sky
You're gonna be grinning with that look in your eye
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to bank
It's really gonna be somethin', and it's gonna be, it's gonna be...

and it's gonna be a long long time
last call, to the line [last call on platform nine]
watch another year pass on by
all aboard the gravy train...
and it's gonna be a long long time
all aboard the gravy train... to nowhere

you've got your ticket and your Samsonite bag
conductor's yellin' 'bout a luggage tag
seat of velvet cushion in the first class
stare out the window but nothin' moves, but nothin' moves past

and it's gonna be a long long time
last call, to the line
watch another year pass on by
all aboard the gravy train...
and it's gonna be a long long time
all aboard the gravy train... to nowhere

your golden handcuffs keep you chained to your desk
the company logo is pinned to your chest
but when they bring to you a simple request
but you're gonna be sleeping, you're gonna be, and it's gonna be...

and it's gonna be a long long time
last call, to the line
watch another year pass on by
all aboard the gravy train...
and it's gonna be a long long time
all aboard the gravy train... to nowhere







Scratch notes:
gonna reach the end of the line
strumming style - emphasise bass note clearly and strum around it
