Soaring over the dunes, red beaked and hungry to dine
A birds eye view, scans the lines, the ebb and flow of the tide,
....
Something catches his eye...

His targets lie on the sand, their greasy cheeks sizzle under the sun
The prize is a packet, a steamy container, the chips are contained there
Our gull and his gullet are grumblin', the food as it's eaten is tumbling
He takes his aim...

His victims grow closer and nearer the moment is nigh
he's locked on his target, he swoops and he swoops and he swoops and
...
But he's spotted...

<something about radars and other airplane military metaphors>

<some type of bridge instrumental as the seagull gives up and searches elsewhere>


Scratch notes:

<verse 1>
unwilling victims unfurl their towels, and steamy packets (of chips)
greasy cheeks in the sun

sand

he swoops and he swoops and he swoops, down to the
He's locked his target,

<verse 2>
Basic story idea: gull finds a group people barbecuing, looks (or smells, althouogh birds can't smell) delicous
He sees the packet of sausages on the table with one of them flopping out
He gets the sausage in his mouth and leaves the scene with a feeling of victory

It turns out the sausage wasn't cooked and it's now lodged in his throat, unchewable
The bird flails in hilarious ways on the ground trying to undo it's mistake, the mischevious
sausage not able to be chewed or broken is undoing this poor bird.

The bird takes flight, hurting corkscrew, feathers flying, total chaos as it fights with this internal
sausage, it takes to the sky and heads towards the ocean where it dives down, performing a kind of
self heimlich manouvre, the hotdog comes out, unappealing to the sharks and fishes who only wish to eat _real_ food

The bird searches on

<instrumental outro>

sausage throat

feathers flying

hurtling corkscrewing parabola as the avian takes to the sky
the sausage is flexing and bending, unbreakable, unshakeable
trouble

this mess is all over the place as dives for the water
