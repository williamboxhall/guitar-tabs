[Verse]
A
Growing into my father's hands
Bm
the veins and scars of an older man
A
peering at these outstretched hands
G
old knuckles trap a wedding band
[trapped in a wedding band]

[Verse interlude]
A Bm A G

[Verse]
A
As the morning's tea leaves brewing
Bm
the egg timer drop pink sand
A
down into my father's hands
G
I gaze upon the way they're moving

[Chorus]
C              Dadd11
Sitting still
    C
but still
             Bm2 A2 G
turning into my old man

[Verse]
A
The father's hands
Bm
grip the pages of The Age
A
between fingers of these ink stained hands
G
a pencil fit to mark the page

[Verse]
A
The smell of newspaper may
Bm
drift into the kitchen
A
and half finished crosswords lay
G
cryptic as the words are written

[Chorus]
C              Dadd11
Sitting still
    C
but still
             Bm2 A2 G
turning into my old man

[Bridge]
Gm7    Dadd11 C
Have I seen enough?
Gm7      Dadd11   C               Bm2
Will his hands be holdin' me much longer?
Gm7        Dadd12    C
Keep these old mitts close at hand
             Bm2 A2 G
The hands of my old man

[Lyrics]
Growing into my father's hands
the veins and scars of an older man
peering at these outstretched hands
old knuckles trap a wedding band

As the morning's tea leaves brewing
the egg timer drop pink sand
down into my father's hands
I gaze upon the way they're moving

Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

The father's hands
grip the pages of The Age
between fingers of these ink stained hands
a pencil fit to mark the page

The smell of newspaper may
drift into the kitchen
and half finished crosswords lay
cryptic as the words are written

Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

Have I seen enough?
Will his hands be holdin' me much longer?
Keep these old mitts close at hand
The hands of my old man





Scratch notes:
a line making it clear that I'm getting weirded out by seeing my dad's hands in my own
tea pot / cosy, dressing gown, oven timer
