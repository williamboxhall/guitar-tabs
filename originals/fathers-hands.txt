[Verse]
Growing into my father's hands
the veins and scars of an older man
stretching out these father's hands
old knuckles trap a wedding band

[Verse]
Growing into my father's hands
I think I'd rather stand
Cradling the tea-can while
the egg timer drops pink sand

[Chorus]
Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man
