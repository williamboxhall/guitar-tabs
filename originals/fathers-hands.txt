[Verse]
Growing into my father's hands
the veins and scars of an older man
stretching out these father's hands
old knuckles trap a wedding band

[Verse]
I think I'd rather stand
Cradling the tea-can
watching the egg timer drop pink sand
down into my father's hands

[Chorus]
Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

[Verse]
The ink stained father's hands
grip the pages of The Age
through fingers of the father's hands
a pencil fit the mark the page

[Verse]
The smell of newspaper may
drift into the kitchen
and half finished crosswords lay
as the water leaves the cistern



tea pot / cosy, dressing gown, oven timer
