[scratch notes]

[verse 1]
Up the ladder on the roof
At my parents house wearing old gardening gloves and my dads bucket hat
Cleaning out the gutters
And the leaves are falling down

Liquidamba spikeballs

[verse 2]
Gloves that would have been much too big
While jumping over the sprinkler in the yard
Mama with the pruning saw / Secateurs
The roses blooming on the arch

And the leaves are falling down

Liquidamba spikeballs

Jacaranda took the cricket bat
Veranda sweet jasmine nectar

the car purrs
mum prunes with the secateurs
and the leaves are falling down

the gloves more mother wore
standing with that pruning saw
under the monstera leaf
a riley cat fast asleep
with his lawnmower purrs
reaching with the secateurs
the roses blooming on the arch
and the leave are falling down

with secateurs my mother prunes
on the arch the roses bloom
and the leaves are falling down

trowel in her pocket

litter rotters on the veranda
beating up the jacaranda
with their bats

[Verse 3 ideas]
My parents getting on in years
TV on for longer hours
Hearing aids on the charger
Deep into autumn now
And the leaves are falling down

tunes you sometimes still play
serenade those autumn days
fingers on the ivory
and the leaves are falling down


autumn brings that welcome breeze
crossword on the mantlepiece
fingers on the ivory
and the leaves are falling down

[bridge ideas]
Sitting in the study
With my dads old knockoff Martin dreadnought
Writing this song
turn a house into a home (ending on C, musical home)
