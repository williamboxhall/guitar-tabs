[Verse]
E                                                      F
when you think you've had it, when you know you've had enough
                  E
give up the fight

E                                                    F
when they call your number, and the writing's on the wall
                E
call it a night

E                                    F          E
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, open wide

E                                    F          E
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, look 'em in the eye



CHORUS

E
running with your hand over your open wound
                       F
played yourself for a fool
                         E
the slow dog's after you

na na na na na na na na na na
                       F
played yourself for a fool
                         E
the slow dog's after you

VERSE 2

E
when you held him by the, when you held him by the
F                           E
scruff, it wasn't enough

E
when you pull his lonely, when you pulled his lonely
F                     E
tail, tryn'a be tough

E                                    F          E
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, look 'em in the eye
E                                    F          E
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, open wide

[lyrics]
when you think you've had a..., when you know you've had enough, give up the fight
when they call your number, and the writing's on the wall, call it a night

sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, look 'em in the eye
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, open wide


when you held him by the, when you held him by the scruff, it wasn't enough
when you pull his lonely, when you pulled his lonely tail, tryn'a be tough

sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, look 'em in the eye
sink your teeth in, dig your nails inside, open wide


running with your hand over your open wound
played yourself for a fool; the slow dog's after you

na na na na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na na
