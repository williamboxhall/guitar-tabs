All aboard the gravy train to nowhere


[Verse 1]
D                  Am           Em       D
We're gonna be swimming in that dopamine sky
Am                Em                 G                  C            D
  You're gonna be grinning with that look in your, that look in your eye
D            Am               Em      D
I'm gonna be laughing all the way to bank
Am                      Em             G				C            D
   It's really gonna be somethin', and it's gonna be, it's gonna be...

[chorus]
F/d         C/d               G/d         D
   and it's gonna be a long long time
F/d	   G/d              F/d 		    G/d
golden handcuffs, in my mind
F/d    C/d                 G/d        D
see another year passing by
F/d  G/d       D/d   F/d      G/d       D
all aboard the gravy train

[refrain]
F/d      C/a                 G/e   D
and it's gonna be a long long time
F/A            G/e				D
all aboard the gravy train... to nowhere
