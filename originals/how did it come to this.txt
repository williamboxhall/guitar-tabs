how did it come to this
      G           A           G    A   D
we're all walkin' through the same abyss

D        G         A
have you heard the myth
    G      A        G   A       D
the hungry ghost on his endless quest

D           G    A
look at his tiny mouth
G        A             G   A D
his wiry arms with his belly stout
D          G       A
he's never satisfied
G           A         G  A D
he's screaming out into the void
