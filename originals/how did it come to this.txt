how did it come to this
      G           A           G    A   D
we're all walkin' through the same abyss

D        G         A
have you heard the myth
    G      A        G   A       D
the hungry ghost on his endless quest


*tap tap tap*
D
is this thing on
D7
can anyone hear this song
Asus4   A7     em          A7   Asus4  D
or is everyone singing the same hungry tune

*tap tap tap*
D
look over here
D7
can anyone see me
Asus4       A7        em              A7   Asus4
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

D      C em/B A

D           G    A
look at his tiny mouth
G        A             G   A D
his wiry arms with his belly stout
D          G       A
he's never satisfied
G           A         G  A D
he's taking it in his ugly stride
