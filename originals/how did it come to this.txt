D          G       A
how did it come to this
      G     A                 G         [D]
we're all walkin' through the same abyss

D        G         A
have you heard the myth
    G      A          G       A       D
the hungry ghost he's calling into the void

*tap tap tap*
D
is this thing on
D7
can anyone hear me
Asus4   A7     em          A7   Asus4  D
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
D
look over here
D7
can anyone see me
Asus4       A7        em              A7   Asus4
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

D      C em/B A
or D D/C D/B Asus4

D           G    A
look at his tiny mouth
G          A           G     D
his long arms with his belly stout
D          G       A
he's never satisfied
G           A         D
he's calling into the void

*tap tap tap*
D
is this thing on
D7
can anyone hear me
Asus4   A7     em          A7   Asus4  D
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
D
look over here
D7
can anyone see me
Asus4       A7        em              A7   Asus4
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

D      C em/B A
or D D/C D/B Asus4

F#m       Em       A
how did it come to this
F#m       Em       A
what did we do to deserve this
F#m               G       A
all we wanted was endless bliss

<verse or chorus>


==== scratch notes ========
this place is a wasteland


Bm
but now we wander aimlessly
A          C   Em/B  A
wasteland...
