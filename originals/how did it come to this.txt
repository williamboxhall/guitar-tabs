D          G       A
how did it come to this
      G     A                 G         [D]
we're all walkin' through the same abyss

D        em         A
have you heard the myth
    em      A          G       A       D
the hungry ghost calling into the void

*tap tap tap*
D
is this thing on
D7
can anyone hear me
Asus4   A7     em          A7   Asus4  D
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
D
look over here
D7
can anyone see me
Asus4       A7        em              A7   Asus4
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

D      C em/B A
or D D/C D/B Asus4

D           G    A
faces move left and right
G          A           G     D
a garden of earthly delights
D           em       A
putting all ghosting aside
      em    a
never satisfied
G           A         D
we're calling into the void

*tap tap tap*
D
is this thing on
D7
can anyone hear me
Asus4   A7     em          A7   Asus4  D
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
D
look over here
D7
can anyone see me
Asus4       A7        em              A7   Asus4
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

D      C em/B A
or D D/C D/B Asus4

F#m       Em       A
how did it come to this
F#m       Em       A
what did we do to deserve this
F#m               G       A
all we wanted was endless bliss

how did it come to this
we're calling into the void



=== straight lyrics ===
[verse 1]
how did it come to this
we're all walkin' through the same abyss
have you heard the myth
the hungry ghost calling into the void

[chorus]
*tap tap tap*
is this thing on
can anyone hear me
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
look over here
can anyone see me
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

[verse 2]
faces move left and right
a garden of earthly delights
putting all ghosting aside
never satisfied
we're calling into the void

[chorus]
*tap tap tap*
is this thing on
can anyone hear me
or is everyone singing their own hungry songs

*tap tap tap*
look over here
can anyone see me
with your wandering eyes watching the same endless sights

[bridge]
how did it come to this
what did we do to deserve this
all we wanted was endless bliss

[outro]
how did it come to this
we're calling into the void





==== scratch notes ========
this place is a wasteland


Bm
but now we wander aimlessly
A          C   Em/B  A
wasteland...
