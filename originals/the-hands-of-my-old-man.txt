[Lyrics]
Sitting still the other day
Doing one thing or another
Watching my hands as I play
Eerily they're like my father's

Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

As the morning's tea leaves brewing
the egg timer drop pink sand
down into my father's hands
I gaze upon the way they're moving

Growing into my father's hands
the veins and scars of an older man
peering at these outstretched hands
old knuckles trap a wedding band

Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

Have I seen enough?
Will his hands be holdin' me much longer?
Keep these old mitts close at hand
The hands of my old man

When the hands of my old man
gripped the pages of The Age
between fingers of those ink stained hands
a pencil fit to mark the page

The smell of newspaper may
drift into the kitchen
and half finished crosswords lay
cryptically the words were written

Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man
