The hands of my old man

[Lyrics]
[Verse]
Sitting still the other day
Doing one thing or another
Watching my hands as I play
Eerily they're like my father's

[Chorus]
Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

[Verse]
As the morning's tea leaves brewing
the egg timer drop pink sand
down into my father's hands
I gaze upon the way they're moving

[Verse]
Growing into my father's hands
the veins and scars of an older man
peering at these outstretched hands
old knuckles trap a wedding band

[Chorus]
Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

[Bridge instrumental]

[Verse]
When the hands of my old man
gripped the pages of The Age
between fingers of those ink stained hands
a pencil fit to mark the page

[Verse]
The smell of newspaper may
drift into the kitchen
and half finished crosswords lay
cryptically the words were written

[Chorus]
Sitting still
but still
turning into my old man

[Outro]
Have I seen enough?
Will his hands be holdin' me much longer?
Keep these old mitts close at hand
The hands of my old man
