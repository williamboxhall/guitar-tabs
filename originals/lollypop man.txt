Bb
The lollypop man
Cm              Bb
standing in the street
Bb
the lollypop man
Cm
standing with his
Gm                 F           Bb
feet in shoes that make him go to sleep

   B         Bb
He packs his bag
   B         Bb
He wipes his mouth
   B         E       Bb
He stands... out.... side

Bb Cm Dm Cm Dm



[Scratch notes]
Early morning after flossing,
leans on bricks near Zebra crossing

by the bureau, orange fluro vest
a silver locket hangs down to his chest
