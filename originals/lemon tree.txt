[Lyrics]
One more year 'round the lemon tree
fig leaf burns on the mantelpiece
hairline cracks in the marble relief
the evergreens cover your door

One last trip to the Esplanade
Broken face on the terrace facade
Casette Tape from a garage sale
kind regards from the humpback whale

[Scratch notes]
No hope in hopetown
sardines in a can

borrowed chords
fabric on the water
