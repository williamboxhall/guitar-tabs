<proper lead in verse>

Walked in the middle of the midnight run
blazing the saddle
< gettin' reflective >
Pellegrini

Seedy little mustard in a hotdog bun
cold in the middle
thrown on the griddle with the liddle one
wished we'd made a daughter or a son



Silly little billycart on the hill
Ran it on the gravel
Single handed steering with a bubble-o bill
Pink' n brown, dripping down the handlebars

Bought yourself baby Taylor solid wood
Bone on the saddle
Couldn't play the barre chords like you thought you would
Filing back your calluses with pumice stone

Push down the pedal to the metal one
hold the clutch in the middle
steerin' with the wheelbarrow grip again
peerin' through the rearview mirror ...



Laid it down on vinyl for the final one
played it on the fiddle
Betamax recording at the Bataclan
argued with manager in Catalan


<chorus>
