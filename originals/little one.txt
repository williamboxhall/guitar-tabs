[Verse]

C             D             G        C
Walked in the middle of the midnight run
G              C
Thinkin' just a little
C          D           G      C
Stopped on Hoddle for another one
G               C            D
memories of the dinner conversation

C             D             G        C
Seedy little mustard in a hotdog bun
G              C
cold in the middle
C          D           G      C
thrown on the griddle with the little one
C          		   D             C		G
wished we'd made a daughter or a son

[Chorus]
C        G
Running along
C            G
If you were around
C                 D
I wonder how your life would be
C        G
Running along
C            G
If you were around
C          		   D             C		G
wished we'd made a daughter or a son

Silly little billy-cart on the hill
Ran it on the gravel
Single handed steering with a bubble-o bill
Pink 'n' brown, dripping down the handlebars

Push down the pedal to the metal one
hold the clutch in the middle
steerin' with the wheelbarrow grip again
peerin' through the rearview mirror

[Chorus]
Running along
If you were around
I wonder how your life would be
Running along
If you were around
peerin' through the rearview mirror


Brought you home baby Taylor solid wood
Bone in the saddle
Couldn't play the barre-chords like you thought you would
Filing back your calluses with pumice stone

Laid it down on vinyl for the final one
played it on the fiddle
Betamax recording at the Bataclan
argued with manager in Catalan

[Chorus]
Running along
If you were around
I wonder how your life would be now

[Bridge of some kind, or "8-bar" or whatever it was called]

Pelligrini's owner had his final one
stabbed with the metal
bleeding on the sidewalk while he's in [her|your] arms
anything can happen at a pasta bar

Never know what life'll give you in the end
Sorry for the muddle
Kiss the ones you love, hug your lovers or friends
Nothing really matters in the end
