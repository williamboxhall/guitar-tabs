standard, capo 5, travis picked 4 strings


[Verse 1]
Sittin' cross-legged
kneeling by the shrine
try'n'a tame my mind the thoughts go racing by

[Verse 2]
Sittin' cross-legged
on the orange couch
got you on my mind I'm trying not to slouch

[Chorus]
Got this little place to come
when everything is said and done
to get away from everyone
a place between the sky, rock, moon and sun

<instrumental short verse>

[Verse 3]
Fairy Martin Swallows
boxing kangaroos
echidna looks for ants with his extended nose

[Verse 4]
You'll find it on the hilltop
walls are painted blue
don't forget your raincoat and your walking shoes

[Chorus]
Got this little place to come
when everything is said and done
to get away from everyone
a place between the formless and the formed

[Bridge]
I'm losing track of time
and pieces of my mind
the self is an illusion... delusion

[Chorus]
Got this little place to come
when everything is said and done
to get away from everyone
where Atman and Brahman are one

OUTRO instrumental like verse but ending back on C
