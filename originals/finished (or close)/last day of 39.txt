[Verse 1]
C    Am     Em G
Last day of 39
C    Am         F        G
Half way to the finish line
C       Am               F                 /D7
Like an old watch that's still keeping time...

[Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em G C Am F G

[Verse 2]
Little baby came at the dawn
5:10 on a Sunday morn
Feeling glad to have even been born...

[Chorus]
Most of the time
When I look at my life
It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em G C Am F G

[Verse 3]
And when I'm 80
Life full of memories
Fading words in a diary

[Bridge]
Em      Am
Passin' time
Em           Am
just stories in my mind
F           D7
I try to be kind...

[Chorus]
Most of the time
When I look at my life
It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em G C Am F G
