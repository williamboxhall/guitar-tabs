[Intro]
2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |  2/4 G  |  4/4 C  |  2/4 G    |  4/4 C	||

[Verse]

C             D           G        C
Walked in the middle of a midnight run
G              C
Thinkin' just a little
C          D           G      C
Stopped on Hoddle for another one
G               C            D
memories of the dinner conversation

C            D            G        C
Seedy little mustard in a hotdog bun
G              C
cold in the middle
C          D           G      C
thrown on the griddle with the little one
C          		   D             C		G
wished we'd made a daughter or a son

[Chorus]
C        G
Running along
C            G
If you were around
C                 D
I wonder how your life would be
C        G
Running along
C            G
If you were around
C          		   D             C		G
wished we'd made a daughter or a son

2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |  2/4 G  |  4/4 C  |  2/4 G    |  4/4 C	||

[Verse]
Silly little billy-cart on the hill
Ran it on the gravel
Single handed steering with a bubble-o bill
Pink 'n' brown, dripping down the handlebars

Push down the pedal to the metal one
hold the clutch in the middle
steerin' with the wheelbarrow grip again
peerin' through the rearview mirror

2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |  2/4 G  |  4/4 C  |  2/4 G    |  4/4 C	||

[Chorus]
Running along
If you were around
I wonder how your life would be
Running along
If you were around
peerin' through the rearview mirror

[Bridge with humming]
2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |   2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |   2/4 C   |   2/4 D   |  4/4 G  |

[Verse]
Laid it down on vinyl for the final one
played it on the fiddle
Betamax recording at the Bataclan
argued with manager in Catalan

Brought you home a baby Taylor solid wood
Bone in the saddle
Couldn't play the barre-chords like you thought you would
wish we'd tried as much as we could

[Chorus]
Running along
If you were around
I wonder how your life would be
Running along
If you were around
wish we'd tried as much as we could







=== scatch notes / cut vereses ===
Consolation cuddle when you missed your friends
Sorry for the muddle
Jumping over puddles in your wellingtons
Fairy bread, lucky dips and lamingtons

[Verse]
Pelligrini's owner had his final one
stabbed with the metal
bleeding on the sidewalk while he's in her arms
total stranger wishing him harm

Never know what life'll give you in the end
Sorry for the muddle
Do the things you love, hug your lovers or friends
That's what really matters in the end
