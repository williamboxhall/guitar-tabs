[Verse 1]
Dadd9                                  C         Am
Red dirt stains the window panes of my old timer camper van
Dadd9                   C              Bm
Vintage cassette radio, play it again Sam

[Verse 2]
Dadd9                                C                  Am
Gave ‘em back the lanyard strap, and borrowed bluetooth keyboard
Dadd9                              C                Am
Washed the walls and shower doors, keys left in the mailbox

[Pre-chorus]
Dadd9
And I don’t know what I’m doing
C
Not sure where I’m goin’
Am
But the wheels are spinnin’   <key to the song, where descriptive merges with symbolic via metaphor>
Dadd9
Keep the good times rollin’

[Chorus]
        G                         Am
But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
                            Em            Dm
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
                             Am                        Bm(add4)
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
                           A6sus4
But I just need to write


[Verse 3]
Dadd9                                     C                Am
Just need the time to sit and write, the deadline closes in
Dadd9                                     C                Bm
My parents caught the midday flight, when will I see you again

[Verse 4]
Dadd9                               C                Am
The bread fell in the garbage bin, another missed meal
Dadd9                         C                 Bm
Flour on the rolling-pin, the deadline closes in

[Pre-chorus]
Dadd9
No time for handsome anti-vaxxers
C
Scientists with waxed moustaches
Am
Curly boys with crocheted puppets
Dadd9
Keep the good times rollin’

[Chorus]
              G                                          Am
But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
                                               Em                 Dm
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
                                                  Am                                    Bm(add4)
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
                           A6sus4
But I just need to write

[Verse 5]
Dadd9                                           C                       Am
Just need to find a coin, So I can make my way back
Dadd9                                                    C                    Bm
But it turns out there’s no change in a land with no cash

[Verse 6]
Dadd9                                            C                    Am
I found myself a simple man with nothing to say,
Dadd9                                                           C                    Bm
And the coal has burned to embers, I don’t want it this way

[Pre-chorus]
Dadd9
But he can fix the engine
C
Of a nuclear submarine
Am
Let’s bring on the mushroom cloud
Dadd9
Keep the good times rollin’

[Chorus]
              G                                          Am
But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
                                               Em                 Dm
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
                                                  Am                                    Bm(add4)
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
                           A6sus4
But I just need to write

[Lyrics no chords]
Red dirt stains the window panes of my old timer camper van
Vintage cassette radio, “play it again Sam”

Gave ‘em back the lanyard strap, and borrowed bluetooth keyboard
Washed the walls and shower doors, keys left in the mailbox

And I don’t know what I’m doing
Not sure where I’m goin’
But the wheels are spinnin’
Keep the good times rollin’

But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
But I just need to write

Just need the time to sit and write, the deadline closes in
My parents caught the midday flight, when will I see you again

The bread fell in the garbage bin, another missed meal
Flour on the rolling-pin, the deadline closes in

No time for handsome anti-vaxxers
Scientists with waxed moustaches
Curly boys with crocheted puppets
Keep the good times rollin’

But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
But I just need to write

Just need to find a coin, So I can make my way back
But it turns out there’s no change in a land with no cash

I found myself a simple man with nothing to say,
And the coal has burned to embers, I don’t want it this way

But he can fix the engine
Of a nuclear submarine
Let’s bring on the mushroom cloud
Keep the good times rollin’

But the dog ate too much kangaroo tail
He howls at the upside down moon, lookin’ frail
Don’t know these upside-down stars in this upside-down sky
But I just need to write







=====Scratch notes=====

Find coin, good omen, to return


No coal left in the fire (only ashes)
The dog ate too much kangaroo tail
	Does he need to be fed, or a pat on the head
	He howls at the upside down moon in an upside down sky
Take the van across the red dirt land
	Of shark teeth, koala paws, and kangaroo tails
Now the ‘rents are gone, And the rents are high
And i just need to write


I don’t know if he needs to be fed, or instead, a look of disgrace <- instead of this line take it somewhere more cosmic, space imagery



[Verse 2]
And I just need the time to sit down write
And I don’t know when I’ll see my folks again
Fresh loaf of bread fell in the bin, One last thing, another missed meal

Lying on the kitchen floor
Trying to work about the courage to roll up a sleeve (I cant reach)
Reach down inside, and slide past a lemon peel
