[Verse 1]
C    am     em 	em
Last day of 39
C    am        em     em
Half way to the finish line
C       Am               F                 /D7
Like an old watch that's still keeping time...

[1/2 Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em em x2

[Verse 2]
5:10 on a Sunday morn
Little baby came at the dawn
Feeling glad to have even been born...

[Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life
E7             am
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life
			
It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em em x2

[Bridge]
Em      Am
Passin' time
Em           Am
just stories in my mind
F           D7
I try to be kind...

[1/2 Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                 G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em em x2

[Verse 3]
And when I'm 83
A life full of memories
Just fading words in a diary

[Chorus]
Most of the time
When I look at my life
Most of the time
When I look at my life
It's pretty alright

[outro]
most of the time
its pretty alright
most of the time
C Am Em em x2
