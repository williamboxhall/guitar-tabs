Intro
C am em em x2

[Verse 1]
C    Am      Em 	Em
Last day of 39
C    Am      Em 	Em
Half way to the finish line
C       Am               F                 D7
Like an old watch that's still keeping time...

[1/2 Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[intro]
C Am Em em x2

[Verse 2]
When I was only one
A "cat's eye" dropped in a marble run
That little kid had so much fun

[Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life
E7             am
Most of the time
D7                G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[Instrumental]
C Am Em em x4

[Bridge]
Em      Am
Passin' time
Em           Am
just stories in my mind
F           D7
I try to be kind...

[1/2 Chorus]
C7             F
Most of the time
D7                 G
When I look at my life

It's pretty alright

[intro]
C Am Em em x2

[Verse 3]
And when I'm 83
A life full of memories
Just fading words in a diary

[Chorus]
Most of the time
When I look at my life
Most of the time
When I look at my life
It's pretty alright
