[Verse 1]
C           G    C
what a sweet nostalgic scene
C              E7     am
spinning in my head again
C              F      am
cleaning out the guttering
am            D7       G
dad directing from the ground

[Verse 2]
C      G           C
borrowed shirt with rolled up sleeves
C                   E7        am
mimicking your look again
C              F      am
the ladder's leaning on the eaves
am        e      d   c   b   c
  and the leaves are falling down

<intro 2: instrumental 1/2 verse>

[Verse 3]
remember when we used to play
leaping through the sprinkler spray
Somewhere there you lost your way
barely see you any more

[Verse 4]
Mama with those gloves she wore
by the roses, callin' us
reaching with the secateurs
And the leaves were falling down

[bridge]
        e      d   c   b   am                       em
And the leaves are falling down beneath a crescent moon
am                       em
waning like that wistful tune
               F
playing in the other room

am em am em F F  F F

[verse 5]
upright in the dining room
you only play when you're alone
echoes through an empty home
fingers on the ivory

[verse 6]
keep my eyes ahead of me
autumn's auburn on the trees
the days are getting shorter now
and the leaves are falling down
and the leaves are falling down
























[scratch notes]

[verse 1]
Up the ladder on the roof
At my parents house wearing old gardening gloves and my dads bucket hat
Cleaning out the gutters
And the leaves are falling down

Liquidamba spikeballs

[verse 2]
Gloves that would have been much too big
While jumping over the sprinkler in the yard
Mama with the pruning saw / Secateurs
The roses blooming on the arch

And the leaves are falling down

Liquidamba spikeballs

Jacaranda took the cricket bat
Veranda sweet jasmine nectar

the car purrs
mum prunes with the secateurs
and the leaves are falling down

the gloves more mother wore
standing with that pruning saw
under the monstera leaf
a riley cat fast asleep
with his lawnmower purrs
reaching with the secateurs
the roses blooming on the arch
and the leave are falling down

with secateurs my mother prunes
on the arch the roses bloom
and the leaves are falling down

trowel in her pocket

litter rotters on the veranda
beating up the jacaranda
with their bats

[Verse 3 ideas]
My parents getting on in years
TV on for longer hours
Hearing aids on the charger
Deep into autumn now
And the leaves are falling down

tunes you sometimes still play
serenade those autumn days
fingers on the ivory
playing in an empty house
and the leaves are falling down


autumn brings that welcome breeze
crossword on the mantlepiece
fingers on the ivory
and the leaves are falling down

droplets on the window pane ⚠️
serenade those autumn days ⚠️
fingers on the ivory ⚠️
and the leaves are falling down ⚠️
and the leaves are falling down ⚠️


[bridge ideas]
Sitting in the study
With my dads old knockoff Martin dreadnought
Writing this song
turn a house into a home (ending on C, musical home)


[structure]
scene setting: I'm on the ladder cleaning the gutters, and having this epiphany about how im building nostalgia now, in a place already connected with a lot of old nostalgia

flashback: playing in the garden with my sister, who im no longer close with, because she's gone off the rails / become radical and hard to be around

<what's the function of my mum here, is it just to continue the leaves falling metaphor?>

<bridge>
a metaphor about night time, crescent moon is night, but also our street, the passing of time and these memories fading like a "Wistful tune". So leaves are memories of past experiences? what's in the other room

mum still plays piano sometimes in the other room
when dad's out of the house, because he never liked it much
but they lead a good life now
days are getting shorter - less days left
by the window the leaves are falling down
