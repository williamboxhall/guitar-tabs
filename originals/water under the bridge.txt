capo 3

[Verse 1]
D             C
Floating by the wheel
D             C
spinning on a watermill
Bm                    Bb7
breadloaf steams on a windowsill
Bb7                 A7
mellow dreams on my mind

[Verse 2]
Sailing with the wind
grazing on the hill
a lamb chews on a daffodil
and water streams off my even keel

[Chorus]
Em                     A7
floating along with the tide
Em               A7
eyes are on the horizon
F                  E7
come along for the ride
Em                      A7
floating along with the tide
Em               A7
eyes are on the horizon
F          Bb7                A7
come along come along for the ride


[Verse 3]
Over endless seas
Chasing down the sun
Past the Mediterranean
water under a bridge

[Verse 4]
Umbrella lifts the storm
Yellow rainhat on
Gumboots filled with a pantheon
Compelling me to continue on

[Chorus]
floating along with the tide
eyes are on the horizon
come along for the ride
floating along with the tide
eyes are on the horizon
come along come along for the ride
