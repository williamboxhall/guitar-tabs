Bb
The lollipop man
Cm              Bb
standing in the street
Bb              Cm
after morning's dental flossing
Gm                F
stands out by the Zebra Crossing

B        Bb
Over the street
    B          Bb
the childrens' feet
      B        Bb
skip along the stripes
   B         F
He wipes his eyes

[Scratch notes]
Early morning after flossing,
leans on bricks near Zebra crossing

by the bureau, orange fluro vest
a silver locket hangs down to his chest
