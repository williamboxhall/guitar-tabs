The lollipop man
Dm              C
standing in the street

stands out by the Zebra Crossing

Over the street

the childrens' feet

He wipes his eyes

he makes his  way he wants to   be...

[Scratch notes]
Early morning after flossing,
leans on bricks near Zebra crossing

by the bureau, orange fluro vest
a silver locket hangs down to his chest
