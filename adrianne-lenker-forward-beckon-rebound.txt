Over the Dead Sea

Bm(b6) Bm D/G
Keeping you company, thinking

Bm Asus D/G
I'm not afraid of you now

Bm Asus D/G
I'm not afraid of you now


Letting my eyes close
Shedding my soft clothes
Wind blows
Wind that howls like a hound
Wind that laughs like a clown
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Virtual bedroom
Rise like a full moon
Show me pictures that hang in your house
Pictures that hang in your mouth
Candescent insects
Crosses and fishnecks
I have nothing to pray to you now
Nothing to pray to you now
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Pulling your face close
Wanting the inmost
Show me
I'm not afraid of you now
I'm not afraid of you now
Villain and violent
Infant and innocent
Baby, both arms cradle you now
Both arms cradle you now
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
