 ok, just when you guys are beginning to think i'm fulla shit for
 saying i'd transcribe this bugger...it's posted, baby, as promised.

 to play this tune, you will need:

 --a guitar
 --patience
 --fingers
 --a capo
 --a midget
 --an electric razor
 --1/2 cup fresh raisins

 the capo needs to be placed behind the FIFTH FRET (if you don't have
 one, use a pencil and a coupla strong rubber bands, or else your big
 sister's hair-barrette, like i did for my first capo--just make sure you wait
 'til she takes it off first). for this tab i have numbered all of the frets
 as if we were counting from the nut and not from the capo, for a few
 reasons. first, it makes everything way easier to understand. secondly, if you
 are not a castrato, a three-year old girl, or jeff buckley himself, you might
 want to consider playing without the capo so you can reach all the notes as
 you sing.

 a few things to remember:

 1. this is not a james brown tune, so don't go chunky-funky with the
 chords.  play each note of a chord individually (classical-style--they should
 still overlap enough to make a chord instead of an arpeggio), and ALWAYS
 downstroke the chords with your pick or your fingies.

 2. give each chord or single note a simple triple count as you play
 it--1(23), 2(23), 3(23), etc. this should establish just the right
 pace for your playing, and it will come in handy later on in the song (you'll
 see).

 3. yeah, there are some funny-looking chords and some inconsistencies
 in the way things are tabbed here. that's part of the song. i tried as
 much as possible to duplicate the way jeff plays it on the recording, and
 that means using different chord inversions where he does, and throwing in
 extra notes for the same reason. i was shooting for accuracy, clarity,
 and economy of motion at the same time. lots of things change from
 verse to verse, so read all the way through and PAY ATTENTION. notes on the
 asterisks (or as we like to call them in indiana, "astericks") will
 follow each section.

 here we go, peops...


 THE INTRO:

 5                 Oooooh...               Oooooh...
 E------------3--2--------------------3--2--0------------------
 B---------5--------5--3--1-----------0--------3--2------------
 G------4-----------------4--2--0-----0-----------2--2---------
 D---2--------------------2--------4--2-----------2-----5--4---
 A-------------------------------------------------------------
 E-------------------------------------------------------------
                                      *

 *(yeah, this is the same Am chord  you arpeggiated at the beginning,
 but a different inversion. that's how he plays it.)

 	remember, each note and chord gets a gentle 1(23) count...


 VERSE THE FIRST:

 5    He bear her...    He bear her to an orchard ground...
 E---3--2--0-----2-----3--2---------------
 B---1--------3--1-----1-----5--3---------
 G---0--------2--2--2--0-----5--0---------
 D---2-----------2-----------0--4--4------
 A------------------------------------5---
 E----------------------------------------

 	nothing strange so far, except a few out-of the way chord
 shapes...


 REFRAIN:

 5    Loo lee...  The falcon hath borne...
 E---3--3--------3-----5-----3--3---
 B---1--3--5--3--3--3--2-----5--3---
 G---0--4--5--4--5--4--2-----4--4---
 D---------4-----5--4--2--4--2------
 A---------------3--2--0-----X------
 E---------------------------0------
                             *

 *these last two chords may also be played like this, for simplicity's
 sake:

 5
 E----------
 B---8------
 G---9--7---
 D---9--9---
 A---7------
 E---0------


 if you listen closely you'll notice that the low E string is actually
 pronounced in the middle of the chord you strike on the other four
 strings. it's a two-guitar thing. we'll talk about that later. for
 now, the


 SECOND VERSE:

 5  And in this...    That was...       In this hold...   And it was laid...
 E-3--2--0-----------3--2--------------3--2--0--------3--3--2--------

 B---1--3--3--3--3--3--2-----5--3---
 G---0--4--5--4--5--4--2-----4--4---
 D---------4-----5--4--2--4--2------
 A---------------3--2--0-----X------
 E---------------------------0------

 	now for the tricky part. we're going to work in the SECOND GUITAR.
 actually, a second guitar has been playing at a lower volume and tone
 setting since the end of the first verse, "beefing up" the chords in
 places. that means you've been doing the work of two guitars--YOU'RE A
 HINDU GUITAR GOD! GIVE YOURSELF A HAND (YOU SEEM TO HAVE SEVERAL EXTRA)!
 anyway, remember the 1(23) count i told you to keep? this is where
 it's  going to make things a lot easier; we're going to have the second
 guitar play three notes to every one of the primary guitarist's. i will set
 the guitar #2 directly under guitar #1 so you can see a direct
 relationship (the arpeggios are dizzying when you listen to them on the disc). part
 #2, by the way, DOES NOT INVOLVE A CAPO--the numbers are the actual
 frets where the string is to be depressed.


 THIRD VERSE (first guitar):

 5    And on this bed there lyeth...      His wound is bleeding day and...

 *or, if you prefer:  D-------5-----3---
                      A---0-7---0-5-----

 **you will notice another guitar playing these two-tone chords:

 	G---1---3---5---7
 	D---2---4---5---7

 with a wee bit more vibrato, to fatten the first guitar part; you
 might
 want your second guitar to play them, if he/she can do it without
 interfering
 with that last couple of notes on the low E string...

 	now back to a single capoed guitar...


 FINAL REFRAIN:

 5   Loo lee...   The falcon hath borne...
 E---------2-----3-----3-5-2---3-2--3------
 B---5--3--1--3--3--3--2-----5------5--3---
 G---5--4--2--4--5--4--2------------4--4---
 D---5-----0-----5--4--2------------2------
 A---3-----------3--2--0------------X------
 E----------------------------------O------
                         *

 *this 5-note melodic passage does not follow the 1(23) beat-per-note
 count; instead it follows the vocal part, shadowing the words "...my
 maiden
 away."


 FINAL VERSE:

 5    By his bed...     "Corpus Christi" written...
 E---3--2--0-----2-----3--2---------------
 B---1--------3--3-----1-----5--3---------
 G---0--------2--4--2--0-----5--0---------
 D---2-----------2-----------0--4--4------
 A------------------------------------5---
 E----------------------------------------


 	look carefully at the last verse--a last-minute variation.

 	now we go back to two guitars, one without a capo. the timing is
 simple, but the way the guitar parts are woven together is meant to
 make you swimmy, so watch out and don't miss your cue...


 INSTRUMENTAL ENDING:

 5    Wooooo..

 *all these notes are actually pinched harmonics (john g or
 michael--did i get the name of this right?), which means you'll actually be hearing a
 tone two octaves higher than the fingering indicates. if you don't know how
 to pull this off, a) ask me or b) just move each fingering up twelve
 frets to at least get a higher sound.

 	i'm pretty sure i'll have to correct this last second guitar
 part, because my guitar's a mile-and-a-half walk from here, it's raining a
 monsoon, and i'm having to do this part from memory. at least you get the idea.
 i'll fix it tommorrow.

 well, how ya like them apples? if you have questions, comments,
 clarifications, corrections, hatemail, whatever, hit me with it.

 wear yourself out...
