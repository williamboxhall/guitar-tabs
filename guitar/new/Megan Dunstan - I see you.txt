[Verse 1]
Atop the hill in the dusky light
I see it all so clear
moon in the wings shy to take flight
caterpillar by my feet

ancient red rock whispers go slow
those red grass fire licks the land
rock wallabies are stirred by all those colours
burning bright

[Chorus]
silver lightning mingles with the flash of red and blue
bird song dovetails with the screaming sirens on the street
I see you
I hear you

[Verse 2]
Uneven scores carved in the earth
by men who should not be
statues in the squares or names of our highways

Vehicle of change transport us back
like songlines echo across the land
ringing over all that bitumen
that bitumen and paint

[Chorus]
silver lightning mingles with the flash of red and blue
bird song dovetails with the screaming sirens on the street
I see you, I hear you

[Verse 3]
Atop the hill in the milky light
I hear it all so clear
cicada hum pierces the night
caterpillar by my feet
