To ruin your sleep

Someone you have to let in
                           Fm
Someone whose feelings you spare

A little, a lot

Someone to make you come through
                 Dm7
Who'll always be there
                 Dm7/G        G7
As frightened as you of being alive

Being Alive
G7
Being Alive

Being Alive

[Verse 1b]
Somebody hold me too close
Somebody hurt me too deep
Somebody sit in my chair and ruin my sleep
And make me aware of being alive
Being alive

[Verse 2b]
Somebody need me too much
Somebody know me too well
Somebody pull me up short and put me through hell
And give me support for being alive
Make me alive
Make me alive

[Bridge]
        Bsus2
Make me confused
             C
Mock me with praise
          Bsus2
Let me be used
        G7
Vary my days
G/Dm7
But alone is alone
Not alive

[Outro verse]
C
Somebody crowd me with love
                     Fm
Somebody force me to care
A5                F
Somebody let come through
               Dm7
I'll always be there
                 Dm7/G           G7
As frightened as you, to help us survive
Being alive
Being alive
Being alive
