[Verse 1]
What a way to change an evening
Was my number hard to find?
You know, I'd given up believing
But the song had somewhat lingered on my mind

[Chorus]
It went la la la la la la la la la
La la, something something, Caroline

[Verse 2]
Caroline, you're like an ember
A rock that burst back into life
A song I only just remember
That goes oh, something something, Caroline

[Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la
La la, something something, Caroline

[Verse 3]
Caroline, we are old now
I got married, and I loved my wife
I have kids, they're good and grown now
All in all, I've been happy with my life
[Chorus]
I was nеver really far from you, was I?
Something, somеthing, Caroline

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I'd like you not to call again
I'd like to keep you off my mind
You're the one who went away, Caroline
So the song was forgotten over time

[Chorus]
It went la la la la la la la la la
La la, something something, Caroline
La la la la la la la la la
La la la, something something, Caroline
