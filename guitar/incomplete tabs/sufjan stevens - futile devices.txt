[Intro]

| Am7/E | Am7/D | D7 |   x4

[Verse 1]

Am7/E
It's been a long, long time
           Am7/D          D7
Since I've memorized your face
Am7/E
It's been four hours now
           Am7/D                 D7
Since I've wandered through your place
Am7/E
And when I sleep on your couch
Am7/D       D7
I feel very safe
Am7/E
And when you bring the blankets
  Am7/D       D7
I cover up my face
           Am7/E
  I        do
 Am7/D    D7
 Love     you
           Am7/E
  I        do
 Am7/D    D7
 Love     you

[Interlude]

| Am7/E | Am7/D | D7 |
| Am7/E | Am7/D | D7 |

[Verse 2]
Am7/E
And when you play guitar
  Am7/D          D7         
I listen to the strings buzz
Am7/E              Am7/D           D7
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
Am7/E
And when you crochet
       Am7/D          D7    
I feel mesmerized and proud
Am7/D
And I would say I love you
    Am7/D         D7       C
But saying it out loud  is hard

[Bridge]
     Bm             Am7
So I won't say it at all
 C    Cm             Am7
And I won't stay very long
     C      Bm      Am7
But you are life I needed all along
            C         Bm
I think of you as my brother
 Am7
Although that sounds dumb
     C         Bm    Am7
And words are futile devices

[Outro]

| Am7/E | Am7/D | D7 |
| Am7/E | Am7/D | D7 |


[Verse 1]
It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face
I do love you
I do, ooh-ooh, love you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard

[Bridge]
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devices

[Outro]
