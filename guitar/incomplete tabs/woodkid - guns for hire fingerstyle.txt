[Verse 1]
Am                        F
  Hold the die, your turn to roll
            Dm                  F
Before they fall through your fingers
Am                            B7
  Not a good night to lose control
             F          E
Right as the earth is unraveling


[Pre-Chorus]
    Bb             B7                Dm Dm7
You play with your blocks until they break
          E                   Am
And these walls come tumbling down
F Em                 Am
Oh  they’re tumbling down
Dm                              F
  You’re out of time, make your move
           Bb         E
Live or die while the fuse is lit and there’s no turning back


[Chorus]
Am                          C
  Kiss your perfect day goodbye
            Dm          F
Because the world is on fire
Am                        B7
  Tuck your innocence goodnight
              F                      E
You sold your friends like guns for hire
   Bb             B7
Go play with your blocks
              Dm              E                   Am
And now you’ll pay when these walls come tumbling down
F  Em              Am  F Em
Oh  they’re tumbling down


[Verse 2]
Am                            F
Resting on a knife, you heavy souls
              Dm                          F
With all this weight buckling down on you now

Don’t you drown, and float away
Am                           B7
  Not a good time to lose control
              F                     Am                  Dm
Right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away


[Pre-Chorus]
                           F
You’re out time, make your move
           Bb         E
Live or die while the fuse is lit and there’s no turning back


[Chorus]
Am                          C
  Kiss your perfect day goodbye
            Dm          F
Because the world is on fire
Am                        B7
  Tuck your innocence goodnight
              F                     Am E
You sold your friends like guns for hire
   Bb             B7
Go play with your blocks
              Dm              E                   Am
And now you’ll pay when these walls come tumbling down
Dm F                 Am  Dm F E
Oh  they’re tumbling down
