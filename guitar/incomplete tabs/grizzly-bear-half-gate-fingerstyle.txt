Intro (Chords strummed twice each):
G Bm Bb Dm
                  F
Past the roaring shore
                Em      C
I have nothing left to hear
                     F
I'm chasing all the words
                   Em         C
But everything you say I only see
                   F
But honestly it's fine
               Em    Dm   C
When I mention how I love you
     Dm    C              Em
It's all I do, even as I stray

C
                     F
We have the cold to keep
                Em      C
I'm not sure I still believe
                    F
My most is nothing more
                    Em     C
Than a place we've been before
                       F
We'll draw and drag it on
                     Em
I'm telling you I'm trying
   Dm         C
To hear this out
       Dm               C
I want nothing more to doubt
                 Bm
A little bit of shame

             Bb         C     G
Which of yourselves is truly gone?
                    Bm
And checked out so long
Bb          Dm
Unhinged, unwound
G            Bm
Come help me on
Bb                Dm
To let lie what's done
G               Bm
In some great beyond
Bb                        Dm       G Bm Bb Dm (Intro again)
You're still there, still as you were

C
                   F
At the end of the line
                    Em         C
It is as if there's no time at all
                F
Nothing left to win
                Em           C
Every pleasure burned to the wick
               F
Content to be alone
                 Em        Dm             C
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
     Dm            C
To remind me once again
              Bm
Why I'm even here

             Bb         C     G
Which of yourselves is truly gone?
                    Bm
And checked out so long
Bb          Dm
Unhinged, unwound
G            Bm
Come help me on
Bb                Dm
To let lie what's done
G               Bm
In some great beyond
Bb                        Dm       G
You're still there, still as you were

G Bm Bb Dm x3

End on G
