[Intro]

Em - D/F# - G - Am


[Verse 1]

Em             D/F#  G
 Four seasons in one day,
Am                         Am6
 lying in the depths of your imagination
Em                 D/F#      G
 Worlds above and worlds below,
Am                                Am6                  C/G
 the sun shines on the black clouds hanging over The Domain
Bm                        C/G
 Even when you're feeling warm,
   Bm                       Am
the temperature could drop a-way
    D                  G     D/F#
Like four seasons in one day


[Verse 2]

Em              D/F#        G
 Smiling as the shit comes down,
Am                     Am6
 you can tell a man from what he has to say
Em                   D/F#  G
 Everything gets turned around,
Am                        Am6         C/G
 and I will risk my neck a-gain, again
Bm                         C/G
 You can take me where you will,
  Bm                          Am
up the creek and through the mill
     Bm                        C/G
Like all the things you can't explain,
D                  G
 four seasons in one day


[Chorus]

C/G           G      D          Em
 Blood dries up like rain, like rain
C/G         G       D                   Em
 Fills my cup, like four seasons in one day


[Instrumental Break]

Em - D/F# - G - Am - Am6 - C/G - B11 - Em - D/F# - G


[Bridge]

  Am                Am6
It doesn't pay to make predictions
Em            D/F#   G
 Sleeping on an unmade bed,
Am                           Am6                C/G
 finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain
Bm             C/G
Only one step away,
D                          G
 like four seasons in one day


[Chorus]

C/G           G      D          Em
 Blood dries up like rain, like rain
C/G         G       D                   Em
 Fills my cup, like four seasons in one day
