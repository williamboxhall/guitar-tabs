[lyrics]
[verse]
It's a little bit magic
Like a river of morning geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the stone face forms and speaks

[chorus]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

[verse]
When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
And the dust goes dancing
And a billion planets are born

[chorus]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

[bridge]
Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

[verse instrumental]

[verse]
There's a dragon in th–µ phone line
Coughing up a mighty flame
With a tongue of silver, silver
Calling out my oldest name

[chorus]
She says, "Hey, you
Do you remember me too?"
We were coiling

[bridge instrumental]
[verse instrumental]

[verse]
It's a little bit magic
Magic
A little bit magic
Magic
