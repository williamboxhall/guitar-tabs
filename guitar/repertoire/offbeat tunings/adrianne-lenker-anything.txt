Staring down the barrel of the hot sun
Shining with the sheen of a shotgun (shotgun)
Carol has a little if we need some
Joa has a ride if we wanna come

Hanging your jeans with a clothespin
Skin still wet still on my skin
Mango in your mouth, juice dripping
Shoulder of your shirtsleeve slipping

Christmas eve with your mother and sis
Don't wanna fight but your mother insists
Dog's white teeth slice right through my fist
Drive to the ER and they put me on risk

Grocery store list, now you get pissed
Unchecked calls and messages
I don't wanna be the owner of your fantasy
I just wanna be a part of your family

And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying

Circle of pine and red oak
Circle of moss and fire smoke
Fan on the ceiling like a wheel spoke
Push the clutch in and I pull the choke

Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking
Wanna listen to your hands soothe
Listen to your heart beating
Listen to the way you move

And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying

Weren't we the stars in Heaven
Weren't we the salt in the sea
Dragon in the new warm mountain
Didn't you believe in me?

You held me the whole way through
When I couldn't say the words like you
I was scared Indigo but I wanted to
I was scared Indigo but I wanted to

And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying
