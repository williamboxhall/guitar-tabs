[Verse 2]
Oh, where is the wanderer?
Who wandered this way
He's passed on his wandering
And will never go away

[Chorus]
Come wander with me, love
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wander with me

[Verse 3]
He sang of a sweet love
Of dreams that would be
But I was sworn to another
And could never be free

[Outro]
