[Verse 1]

G               C      G             D          G
Go 'way from my window leave at your own chosen speed
    G               C               G       D       G
I'm not the one you want, Babe, I'm not the one you need
    Bm                 Am                      Bm              Am
You say you're looking for someone who's never weak but always strong
    Bm               Am               Bm               Am
To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong
    C                          D
Someone to open each and every door


[Chorus]

             G
But it ain't me, Babe
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe


[Verse 2]

   G                C               G       D      G
Go lightly from the ledge, Babe, go lightly on the ground
    G               C                  G    D       G
I'm not the one you want, Babe, I will only let you down
    Bm                 Am                   Bm               Am
You say you're looking for someone who will promise never to part
    Bm               Am                Bm               Am
Someone to close his eyes for you, someone to close his heart
    C                            D
Someone who will die for you and more


[Chorus]

             G
But it ain't me, Babe
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe


[Verse 3]

   G                C      G            D               G
Go melt back in the night, everything inside is made of stone
        G               C          G      D        G
There's nothing in here moving and anyway I'm not alone
    Bm                 Am
You say you're looking for someone
       Bm                        Am
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
   Bm              Am
To gather flowers constantly
        Bm                Am
and to come each time you call
   C                              D
A lover for your life and nothing more


[Chorus]

             G
But it ain't me, Babe
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe
