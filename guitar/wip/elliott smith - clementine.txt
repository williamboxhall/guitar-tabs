[Verse 1]
D
They're waking you up to close the bar
                                                   F#m
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
D
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
                                   F#m
While he's turning around the open sign

[Short Chorus]
G               A7
"Dreadful sorry, Clementine"

[Bridge]
G                        A
Though you're still her man
           D          E
It seems a long time gone
G                        E
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
G                    A7
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?

[Verse 2]
D
You drank yourself into slow-mo
                     F#m
Made an angel in the snow
D
Anything to pass the time
                               F#m
And keep that song out of your mind

[Chorus]
Bb
"(Oh) Oh my darling
G
(Oh) Oh my darling
      D        E
Oh my darling, Clementine
G               A7
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
D
