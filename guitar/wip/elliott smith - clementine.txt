(C G C E A D) or just DADF#BE

[Verse 1]
They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
While he's turning around the open sign

[Chorus]
"Dreadful sorry, Clementine"

[Bridge]
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?

[Verse 2]
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
Anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind

[Chorus]
"(Oh) Oh my darling
(Oh) Oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
