Chord progression varies slightly per LP and cassette version of LIGHT GREEN
LEAVES. These chords are also used for "I Thought You Were Singing To Me" off the
album HARVEST JOY (aka "Dove My Dove" off of BIGFOOT), "Sing Wide" and "Laugh Now"
off of MAGIC WAND, and maybe some others.



Hear it like a pounce upon a peak, oh
Look at what the light did now
Bear it like a bounce upon the beak, oh
Look at what the light did now
Land and water and bird or beast, oh
Look at what the light did now
Shiny little band or golden fleece, oh
Look at what the light did now

[Chorus]
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
In my will I went 'till it's wasted
Look at what the light did now
Taste the taste I taste 'till it's tasted
Look at what the light did now
Bought it like a boast that burly beaming
Look at what the light did now
Got it like a ghost that girly gleaming
Look at what the light did now

[Chorus]
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now

Like a dead tree that's dry and leaving
Look at what the light did now
Play it on me with grief and grieving
Look at what the light did now
I would finally fall to pieces
Look at what the light did now
We'll meet soon as nephew's nieces
Look at what the light did now

[Chorus]
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did nowc
