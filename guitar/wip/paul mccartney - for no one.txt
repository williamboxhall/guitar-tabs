[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 2]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo: Alan Civil]

[Chorus]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone, but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Chorus]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
