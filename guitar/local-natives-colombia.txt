[Verse]
G                            F#m               Em
 The day after I had counted down all of your breaths down until
A     D                       F#m                      A
there   were none, were none,    were none, were none;
G                                        F#m              Em
 A hummingbird crashed right in front of me and I understood all
        A        D                    F#m                  A
you did for us.   You gave, and gave,   and gave, and gave.
G                    F#m      Em
 Ohhh, every night I ask myself

[Chorus]
               A
Am I giving enough?
D                F#m
Am I giving enough?
F#m
Am I giving enough?
A
Am I?

[Verse]
G
If you never knew how much,
             F#m                Em
If you never felt all of of my love.
       A   D                 F#m               A
I pray now   you do, you do,   you do, you do.
G                   F#m      Em
 Ohhh, every night I ask myself

[Chorus]
               A
Am I loving enough?

Am I loving enough?
F#m
Am I loving enough?
A
Am I?

Am I giving enough?

Am I giving enough?

Am I giving enough?
